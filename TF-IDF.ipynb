architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and st regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring   carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers all as you would expect and more the christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning hats off to the extraordinary designer the rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers crystal chandeliers deep crown moldings luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks tv in the mirror deep soaker tub separate shower and european style private flush the beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world the full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well they look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished wi fi is included as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service the mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers the rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean all the staff are friendly from the doormen waiters maids valets etc we opted out for the platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in astor court with a nice menu selection well prepared and quickly served the bad being an spg member for   years with over   nights to date and lifetime platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the spg policy it is something we have always received at all spg properties   of the time since gaining platinum status many many years ago we booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn t like they didn t know we were coming we even processed our suite nights awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade we had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire dec     they are useless to us now our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded it went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade she didn t seem to understand the platinum perks talking with her was like talking to a wall so unlike other   star hotels we ve stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed we were shown to our grand luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go i will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets over the years i hate to think what my husband has spent at spg hotel stays to have earned his lifetime platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as   nights in one year alone with spg he was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to nyc on a thanksgiving holiday since   when we met and had our very first trip together of course when you don t get a suite you don t get the toiletries that go with it which i ve always loved at the st regis i suppose i could have requested it but i didn t we just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday the ugly staying at the hotel for a week one of the expected highlights was thanksgiving dinner at astor court we thought we d stay in house after long hours watching the macy s parade huge mistake upon arrival at astor court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with   tiny bar chairs we couldn t believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date the meal was worse then i can describe and actually included processed turkey not even real turkey i couldn t understand why i was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner now i know no one in their right mind would pay   usd for that miserable meal for two people i can t adequately describe our disappointment we have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as new year s eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid we couldn t even eat the salads what kind of chef can t make a salad seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a   credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for thanksgiving dinner that just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her i don t think i could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully i can t blame him it s a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a   star dining room after visiting   other st regis hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their nyc hotel just doesn t even make sense dear katherine b

    "# Finding Optimal Clusters\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised operation, and KMeans requires that we specify the number of clusters. One simple approach is to plot the SSE for a range of cluster sizes. We look for the \"elbow\" where the SSE begins to level off. MiniBatchKMeans introduces some noise so I raised the batch and init sizes higher. Unfortunately the regular Kmeans implementation is too slow. You'll notice different random states will generate different charts. Here I chose 14 clusters."
